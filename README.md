# CV-Application

Check it out [link](https://hix160.github.io/CV-Application/)

This is a project that I built locally on my computer. It was one of several tasks given by **The Odin Project** courses to help familiarize myself with React.

The task can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).
